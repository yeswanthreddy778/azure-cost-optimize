# azure-billing-cost-optimization
Azure serverless cost optimization solution using Cosmos DB and Blob Storage

# Azure Billing Cost Optimization

This solution offloads rarely accessed billing records from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage using Azure Functions. It reduces storage and read costs while maintaining data availability and API compatibility.

## Functions
- archive-function: Moves old records to blob
- proxy-function: Reads from blob if record not in Cosmos DB

## Tech Used
Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, FastAPI, Python

## ðŸ“Œ Challenge Prompt (Provided by Recruiter) 

> **Cost Optimization Challenge: Managing Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture**  
>
> We have a serverless architecture in Azure, where one of our services stores billing records in Azure Cosmos DB. The system is read-heavy, but records older than three months are rarely accessed.  
>
> Over the past few years, the database size has significantly grown, leading to increased costs. We need an efficient way to reduce costs while maintaining data availability.
>
> ### Current System Constraints:
> - **Record Size**: Each billing record can be as large as 300 KB  
> - **Total Records**: Over 2 million records  
> - **Access Latency**: When an old record is requested, it should still be served, with a response time in the order of seconds  
>
> ### Solution Requirements:
> - Simplicity & Ease of Implementation  
> - No Data Loss & No Downtime  
> - No Changes to API Contracts  
>
> **Bonus Points:**
> - Include an architecture diagram  
> - Provide pseudocode, commands, or s
